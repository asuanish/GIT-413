    <h2>Mom & Pop Bakery Topple Big Manufacturers</h2>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Amigos Bakery is a local business centered around selling everything Mexican bakery.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>There was no existing online presence for this bakery so establishing a website was
needed. Being new to the area the owners just wanted a site to give information;
ordering was not a part of the initial website.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>I researched other bakery sites to get a sense for the industry standard layout along
with brainstorming possible improvements. Understanding my clients wanted two
distinct viewing modes, for accessibility reasons, finding contrasting color combinations
was a must.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Clients saw an increase in customer traffic along with featured items being requested
daily</p>

    <h2>Ranking of Kings: Bojji</h2>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Bojji is the main character from the anime Ranking of Kings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>Lack of fanart for the main character.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>Rewatched the most significant episodes where Bojji made iconic actions. Him not
saying much means his emotions need to be front and center. These still shots
represent a change in his intentions invigorating the viewer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Surge of fanart has propelled more first time viewers increasing the ratings totals.</p>

      <p>Tea Bliss is a local boba shop offering refreshments along with snack items.</p>

    <div class="study-section">
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>Being such a new store, there is no current online presence. This directly hurts the
businesses bottom line because most refreshment stores offer online ordering
increasing brand recognition.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>I researched my favorite boba websites both mobile and desktop versions. Implemented
a fellow classmate's accessibility idea through organization by color. Took the already in
place categories to build out the menu tab.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="study-section">
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Clients experienced a boom in online orders minimizing their down times along with
improving profits.</p>

            <h3>Project One</h3>
            <p>
              I developed this dynamic Mexican bakery website as my GIT 417 Advanced Web Markup and Scripting final project. From concept to execution, I designed and coded every aspect to deliver an engaging user experience. Key features include a theme switcher, a product picker for personalized orders, an intuitive contact form, and a fun interactive game for users.
